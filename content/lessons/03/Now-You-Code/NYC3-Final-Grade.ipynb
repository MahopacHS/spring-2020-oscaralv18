How many times must you execute this program and check the output before you canbe reasonably assured your code is correct? Explain.\n\nAnswer:  at least 13 times to get to all possible inputs\n\n\n3. When testing this program do you think its more important to test numbers in the middle of the grade range or exactly on the boundary between one grade range and the next. Justify your response.\n\nAnswer:  between grade boundaries to make sure the program can pick the correct side\n\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\nthis was a very repetitive program to code and an easy task. i understand it and can probably explian it to someone "
