Modify the program to print `that is not a paint quality` and then exit in those cases.\n\nAnswer:   it just crashes because the program can't process that input\n\n\n2. What happens when you enter something other than `'y'` or `'n'` for color matching? Re-write the program to print `you must enter y or n` whenever you enter something other than those two values.\n\nAnswer:  it crashes the program can't process that response \n\n\n3. Why can't we use Python's `try...except` in this example?\n\nAnswer:   don't understNd how we cannot use it \n\n\n4. How many times (at minimum) must we execute this program and check the results before we can be reasonably assured it is correct?\n\nAnswer:  6\n\n\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\ni understand the process of programming this and understand how to space it better. it still gets complicated dealing with several inputs and outputs "
