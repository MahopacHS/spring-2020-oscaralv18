This process will repeat until you enter quit as which point the program will exit.\n\nWow. Seems complicated! We'll use the technique called **problem simplification** to make this problem a little easier to solve.\n\nFirst we'll write a complete program to solve *part* of the problem, then we will take our new level of understanding to solve the *entire* problem.\n\n## Start with Sub-Problem 1\n\nLet's write a program to simply input a number and then uses a loop to print out the multiplication table up to 10  for that number. \n\nFor example, when you input `5`:\n\n```\nEnter number to multiply by: 5\n1 x 5 = 5\n2 x 5 = 10\n3 x 5 = 15\n4 x 5 = 20\n5 x 5 = 25\n6 x 5 = 30\n7 x 5 = 35\n8 x 5 = 40\n9 x 5 = 45\n10 x 5 = 50\n```\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\ni struggled to make it a comstant loop but after a bit of thinking i got it and place the while in the correct location. i truly couldnt make it work because i didnt upercase the t in True and it kept crashing \n"
