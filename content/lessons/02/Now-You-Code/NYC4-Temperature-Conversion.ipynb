Is this an error?\n\nAnswer:  a negative number won't stop the algorithim because it still makes sense \n\n\n2. Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain.\n\nAnswer:   no, its the same process \n\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why? \n\nAnswer: yes i did because it makes it less confusing  \n\n\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\ni understand this lesson clearly and know what i am doing.
