It first prompts you to input the total amount of your check, then the number of people dining. It should then output the amout each diner must contribute to the check.  For example:\n\n```\n*** Check Splitter ***\nHow much is the amount of the check? 100.00\nHow many people ? 6\nEach person owes: $16.67\n```\n\nNOTE: Use string formatters to display the output to two decimal places.\n"

What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or $60 as the amount of the check, instead of 60?\n\nAnswer:   it doesn't work because the algorithm only accepts numbers and nothing else \n\n\n2. What type of error is this? Do you think it can be handled in code?\n\nAnswer:   value error, i think it could be solved but we haven't learned how to yet \n\n\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? Does the program run? Does it make sense? \n\nAnswer:   it does run and the ouput does make sense \n\n\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\ni think i can understand this lesson and i am capable of doing it on my own but i dont think i can teach someone else to do it. it was a little difficult to grasp in the beginning but now i more or less understand it. just certain things like where the % must go in the () throw me off\n"
